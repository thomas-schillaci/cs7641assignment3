My code is available on github at:

https://github.com/thomas-schillaci/cs7641assignment3

My code was developped on a python3.7 environment but should work with python3.6.

My repository contains a pyhon package Assignment3 with two files:

	- main.py which contains te code used for the analysis
	- utils.py which contain utility functions

Launching main.py is enough for my whole analysis to be computed, but it takes quite a long time (with a good cpu and a decent gpu). The running time of each call is indicated at the end of the main file.
